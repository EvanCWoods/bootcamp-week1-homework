# bootcamp-week1-homework

## Overview

This repository contains the code used in the week 1 homework for the **full-stack-flex bootcamp** from The **University of Sydney.** The root directory contains the files necessary for running the code through **githjub pages** (index.html and the assets folder).

The folder titled **'02-Homework'** was the original working directory, but it had to be moved to the root for github pages. It is there for commit history.

The folder titled **'usyd-syd-virt-fsf-pt-11-2021-u-c'** is from the original git clone from the gitlab uniot site.
